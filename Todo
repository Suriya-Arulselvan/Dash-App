PRIORITY

5. Auto-size subplots

DONE 1. Title each graph

DONE 6. Select color scale for each plot - PCA , parallel

DONE 2. Create divisions for each subplots - create styles for each of them

DONE 3. Test with multicase analysis results

DONE 4. Performance with large data - create tabs for each analysis

7. Horizontal variable names for scatter plot and PCA, slanted for parallel coordinates

8. Create_distPlot is not performant

9. Use go.splom instead of px.scatter_matrix Add color scale for scatter plot. 

DONE 10. Additional checks in 2d and 3d plots

DONE 11. Modularize the project structure

DONE 12. BugFixes pending in factor analysis

13. SVR and Kernel Ridge regression for 3D plots
